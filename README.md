# PaintorX-Firmware
This is a custom build of Marlin for the Paintor-X.

This firmware is modified to allow printing plastics at 1mm extrusion rates.
It is optimized around NEMA 23 motors with higher current being used to drive them.
It also keeps the z axis off when not in use to allow manual setting of the first layer height.
